# Stakers

Tracks the number of unique wallets holding active TUNA stakes over time. The count increases when wallets stake and decreases when wallets fully unstake, providing a view of protocol adoption and participant retention.

## Data

<BrowserOnly fallback={<div style={{ minHeight: '800px', display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}><LoadingSpinner /></div>}>
  {() => {
    const UsageTimeSeriesChart = require('@site/src/components/Usage/UsageTimeSeriesChart').default;

## Use Cases

This chart helps you:

- **Track protocol adoption**: Monitor growth in the number of wallets participating in TUNA staking
- **Assess user retention**: Identify periods of staker growth vs. churn (unstaking)
- **Evaluate engagement trends**: Compare active staker counts with [usage statistics](/analysis/usage-statistics/) for daily and weekly active users
- **Identify committed participants**: Use the Top Staker Wallets table to find the most consistently engaged stakers
- **Correlate with revenue**: Cross-reference staker growth with [revenue trends](/analysis/defituna/revenue-breakdown/by-type) to understand protocol health

## How to Read This Chart

**Active Stakers Time Series:**
- **X-axis**: Date (UTC days)
- **Y-axis**: Number of unique wallets with staked TUNA balance > 0
- **Line trend**: Shows cumulative count of wallets holding active stakes at the end of each day
- **Increases**: New stakers or wallets that restaked
- **Decreases**: Wallets that fully unstaked all their positions

**Top Staker Wallets Table:**
- **Wallet Address**: Solana address of the staker (links to Solscan)
- **Ranking metric**: Sorted by number of distinct days the wallet executed staking instructions (staking, unstaking, claiming rewards, compounding)
- **Purpose**: Identifies the most consistently active stakers, not necessarily the largest stake holders

## Methodology

<details>
<summary>Click to expand technical details</summary>

**Data Sources**

- **Staking transactions**: On-chain staking instructions from DefiTuna staking program
- **Balance snapshots**: Daily end-of-day snapshots of staked TUNA balances per wallet
- **Activity tracking**: Daily records of which wallets executed staking-related instructions

For complete pipeline details, see [Data Pipeline](/analysis/methodology).

**Active Staker Calculation**

A wallet is counted as an **active staker** on a given day if:
1. Its staked TUNA balance > 0 at 23:59:59 UTC
2. The balance is checked via snapshot after processing all transactions for the day

**Counting Logic:**
- **New staker**: Wallet stakes for the first time or restakes after previously unstaking fully
- **Continuing staker**: Wallet already had a staked balance and it remains > 0
- **Removed staker**: Wallet unstakes all TUNA, reducing balance to exactly 0

This approach provides a **point-in-time count** rather than cumulative totals, reflecting the actual number of participants with active stakes.

**Top Staker Ranking**

The Top Staker Wallets table ranks by:
- **Activity frequency**: Number of distinct calendar days (UTC) the wallet executed staking instructions (staking, unstaking, claiming rewards, compounding)
- **Not by stake size**: Large stake holders who rarely interact may not appear in top ranks
- **Purpose**: Highlights committed, consistently engaged participants

This metric complements stake size analysis (available in [Staker Conviction](/analysis/defituna/staker-conviction)) by focusing on behavioral engagement.

**Update Frequency**

Data is automatically updated once a day. Check the "Last updated" timestamp in the site header for data freshness.

**Known Limitations**

- Point-in-time snapshots don't capture intra-day staking/unstaking activity
- Wallets that stake and unstake on the same day may not appear in counts if balance is 0 at end of day
- Multi-wallet users (same person controlling multiple addresses) are counted separately
- Does not account for stake size, only presence/absence of active stake
