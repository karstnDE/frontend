# Wallet Usage

Tracks unique wallets interacting with the DefiTuna protocol through revenue-generating actions. Daily metrics capture single-day activity, while weekly metrics show rolling 7-day participation to identify sustained engagement patterns.

## Data

<BrowserOnly fallback={<div style={{ minHeight: '800px', display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}><LoadingSpinner /></div>}>

## Use Cases

This page helps you:

- **Track protocol adoption**: Monitor growth in unique wallets using the protocol daily
- **Identify engagement patterns**: Compare daily spikes with sustained weekly activity to distinguish one-time users from regular participants
- **Assess user retention**: Weekly active wallet trends reveal whether users return after their first interaction
- **Evaluate protocol changes**: Identify the impact of feature launches, parameter updates, or integrations on usage numbers by comparing activity before and after changes
- **Benchmark growth**: Use daily and weekly metrics to measure protocol health over time
- **Identify power users**: Use the Top Daily Users table to find the most consistently engaged wallets

## How to Read These Charts

**Daily Active Wallets Chart:**
- **X-axis**: Date (UTC days)
- **Y-axis**: Number of unique wallets executing fee-generating actions each day
- **Spikes**: May indicate marketing campaigns, token launches, or protocol events
- **Baseline**: Represents core user base executing regular transactions

**Weekly Active Wallets Chart:**
- **X-axis**: Date (UTC days)
- **Y-axis**: Rolling 7-day union of active wallets (counts each wallet once even if active on multiple days)
- **Smooths volatility**: Filters out single-day spikes to show sustained engagement trends
- **Lag effect**: Changes appear gradually due to 7-day rolling window

**Top Daily Users Table:**
- **Wallet Address**: Solana address (links to Solscan)
- **Days Active**: Total distinct days the wallet executed fee-generating transactions
- **Transactions**: Total number of fee-generating transactions across all days
- **First/Last Seen**: Date range of wallet activity
- **Staking Timeline**: Link to view detailed staking activity for each wallet

## Methodology

<details>
<summary>Click to expand technical details</summary>

**Data Sources**

- **Transaction logs**: On-chain fee-generating transactions from DefiTuna protocol
- **Wallet identification**: Unique Solana addresses executing protocol instructions
- **Activity tracking**: Daily records of which wallets executed fee-generating actions

For complete pipeline details, see [Data Pipeline](/analysis/methodology).

**Fee-Generating Actions**

A wallet is counted as active when it executes transactions that generate protocol fees. This includes:

- **Liquidity operations**: Swaps, adding/removing liquidity
- **Position management**: Opening, closing, or adjusting positions
- **Liquidations**: Liquidating underwater positions
- **Other revenue-generating activities**: Any operation that contributes to treasury revenue

**Excluded activities:**
- Staking/unstaking operations (tracked separately in [Stakers](/analysis/defituna/usage-statistics/usage-statistics-stakers))
- Failed transactions
- System transactions without fee generation

**Daily Active Wallets Calculation**

For each UTC day:
1. Collect all successful fee-generating transactions
2. Extract unique wallet addresses from transaction signers
3. Count distinct addresses per day

This provides a **snapshot count** of unique participants each day, with wallets counted once per day regardless of transaction frequency.

**Weekly Active Wallets Calculation**

For each UTC day:
1. Collect all unique daily active wallets from the past 7 days (including current day)
2. Count distinct addresses across the 7-day window
3. Each wallet counted once even if active on multiple days within the window

This **rolling 7-day union** smooths daily volatility and highlights sustained participation patterns.

**Top Daily Users Ranking**

The Top Daily Users table ranks by:
- **Activity frequency**: Number of distinct calendar days (UTC) the wallet executed fee-generating transactions
- **Not by transaction volume**: A wallet with 100 transactions on 1 day ranks below a wallet with 10 transactions on 10 different days
- **Purpose**: Identifies consistently engaged users rather than high-volume traders

**Update Frequency**

Data is automatically updated once a day. Check the "Last updated" timestamp in the site header for data freshness.

**Known Limitations**

- Only tracks fee-generating activities; non-revenue operations excluded
- Multi-wallet users (same person controlling multiple addresses) are counted separately
- Does not measure transaction size or volume, only participation
- Single-day spike can inflate weekly metric for up to 7 days due to rolling window
- Cross-protocol users (using multiple protocols) appear as separate wallets per protocol
