# Revenue by Wallet

This page provides wallet-level revenue analysis, attributing protocol revenue to individual user wallets based on transaction initiators (feePayer).

## Overview

Revenue is attributed to wallets that initiate transactions generating protocol fees. This analysis helps identify:

- **Revenue distribution** across the wallet population
- **Power users** contributing significant protocol revenue
- **Whale behavior** through individual wallet timelines
- **Transaction patterns** of high-revenue wallets

## Wallet Revenue Distribution

The histogram below shows how many wallets fall into each revenue cohort. The logarithmic ranges help visualize the distribution from small contributors to high-revenue users.

**Use the "Exclude Liquidations" filter** to see revenue distribution from non-liquidation activities only.

## Individual Wallet Analysis

Enter any wallet address to see its complete revenue timeline, including:

- **Cumulative revenue** over time
- **Transaction events** with type, amount, and Solscan links
- **Revenue breakdown** by transaction type
- **Activity period** (first and last transactions)

## Methodology

### Revenue Attribution Method

This analysis attributes revenue to **position owners** - the wallets whose LP positions generate protocol fees or are liquidated.

**Attribution Logic:**
1. **Identify Position Owner**: Wallet that sends tokens to the treasury (highest outflow)
2. **Liquidations**: Attributes revenue to the liquidation victim, not the liquidator
3. **LP Operations**: Attributes revenue to the wallet opening/managing the position

**Exclusions:**
- **`collect_protocol_fees`**: Excluded because these are aggregate fee collections from multiple positions, not attributable to individual owners

**Example:** If a liquidator bot liquidates a user's position generating 10 SOL revenue, the **user wallet** (position owner) is attributed the 10 SOL, not the bot.

### What This Analysis Shows

This attribution answers: **"Which wallets own positions that generate protocol revenue?"**

- Shows actual users whose capital generates fees
- Liquidation victims whose positions contribute to treasury
- LP providers earning fees for the protocol

### Data Scope

- **Revenue Calculation**: Direct WSOL inflows to treasury only
- **Token Conversion**: Non-WSOL tokens not included (requires price conversion)
- **Multiple Wallets**: No cross-wallet aggregation for users with multiple addresses

### Cohort Ranges

Cohort ranges are automatically determined based on actual revenue distribution to ensure meaningful bucketing across the wallet population.

## Interpretation Guide

### High-Revenue Wallets

Wallets in the top cohorts (100+ SOL) typically represent:
- Active liquidity providers
- Frequent position adjusters
- Long-term protocol users

### Timeline Patterns

- **Steep increases**: Large transactions or high-activity periods
- **Flat periods**: Wallet inactivity
- **Liquidation events**: Red markers indicate liquidation-based revenue

### Filtering Liquidations

The "Exclude Liquidations" filter helps distinguish:
- **Organic revenue**: From user-initiated trading activities
- **Forced revenue**: From automated liquidations

## Use Cases

### Protocol Analysis

1. **User Segmentation**: Identify different tiers of protocol users
2. **Retention Analysis**: Track wallet activity duration and patterns
3. **Whale Tracking**: Monitor high-revenue wallet behavior

### Business Insights

1. **Revenue Concentration**: Understand what percentage of revenue comes from top wallets
2. **User Value**: Quantify lifetime value per wallet
3. **Engagement Metrics**: Correlate transaction frequency with revenue contribution
