# Pool Ramp-Up Analysis

Tracks revenue growth from each pool's first revenue-generating day, showing which pools gained the most user interest early on. Compares cumulative revenue trajectories across all pools over their first 90 days, revealing growth patterns, early leaders, and pools with the steepest revenue curves.

## Data

<BrowserOnly fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
  {() => {
    const PoolRampUpChart = require('@site/src/components/Dashboard/PoolRampUpChart').default;
    return <PoolRampUpChart />;
  }}
</BrowserOnly>

## Use Cases

This page helps you:

- **Compare pool performance**: See which pools generated revenue fastest from Day 1
- **Identify early winners**: Spot pools that attracted immediate user activity after launch
- **Analyze growth patterns**: Compare steady growers vs. pools with explosive growth or spikes
- **Evaluate pool maturity**: Track how long it takes pools to reach revenue milestones
- **Benchmark new pools**: Compare newer pool trajectories against historical performance
- **Assess pool lifecycle**: Understand typical revenue patterns in the first 90 days

## How to Read This Chart

**Multi-Line Chart:**
- **X-axis**: Days since establishment (1-90 days). "Day 1" is defined as the first date a pool appears in `realized_by_pool` with revenue > 0 (may differ from actual on-chain pool creation date if pool was inactive initially)
- **Y-axis**: Cumulative revenue in SOL
- **Lines**: One line per pool showing cumulative revenue trajectory
- **Colors**: Automatically assigned to each pool
- **Steepest curves**: Pools with fastest revenue growth from Day 1
- **Early leaders**: Pools that started generating significant revenue immediately
- **Growth patterns**: Steady linear growth vs. spikes or exponential curves
- **Final values**: Cumulative value at Day 90 shows total revenue over first 3 months

**Interactive Features:**
- **Days slider**: Adjust the time window (7-90 days) to focus on early growth or full lifecycle
- **Pool visibility buttons**: "Select All Pools", "Deselect All Pools", or "10 Newest Pools" for quick filtering
- **Default visibility**: Pools are hidden by default if they generated less than 5 SOL cumulatively in their first 90 days, or if they are SOL-USDC pools (Orca SOL-USDC Whirlpool and Fusion SOL-USDC Pool) - use "Select All Pools" to show all pools
- **Hover on lines**: See pool name, day number, date, daily revenue, and cumulative total
- **Click legend**: Show/hide individual pools to declutter the view
- **Double-click legend**: Isolate a single pool to focus on its trajectory
- **Drag to zoom**: Select specific date ranges or revenue ranges
- **Double-click chart**: Reset zoom to see all pools

## Methodology

**Key Concepts**

- **Pool Establishment**: Defined as the first revenue-generating transaction from the pool
- **Day 1**: The first day a pool appears in `realized_by_pool` with revenue > 0
- **Cumulative Revenue**: Running total of all revenue generated by the pool since Day 1
- **Time Horizon**: First 90 days of each pool's life

**Data Source**

Revenue data is extracted from the `realized_by_pool` field in daily `.realized.json` cache files:
- Each day's revenue is attributed to specific pool IDs
- Pool names are looked up from `config/pool_labels.json`
- Pools are sorted by total revenue (descending)

**Calculation Process**

For each unique pool:

1. **Identify Establishment Date**: Find the first date with revenue > 0
2. **Build Daily Series**: Track revenue for each day from establishment
3. **Calculate Cumulative Total**: Sum all revenue from Day 1 to Day N
4. **Limit Time Window**: Track up to 90 days from establishment

**Example**

For the Fusion SOL-USDC Pool established on 2025-07-31:

```
Day 1 (2025-07-31): 1.3e-05 SOL daily → 1.3e-05 SOL cumulative
Day 2 (2025-08-01): 0.0 SOL daily → 1.3e-05 SOL cumulative
Day 3 (2025-08-02): 1.5e-05 SOL daily → 2.9e-05 SOL cumulative
...
Day 90 (2025-10-28): 22.1 SOL daily → 1,650.43 SOL cumulative
```

**Limitations**

- **Establishment Date Accuracy**: "First revenue date" may differ from actual pool creation - some pools may have been created but inactive initially, on-chain pool creation timestamp is not tracked, we only detect when revenue first appears
- **Data Availability Variance**: Pools established at different times have different data coverage (July pools: ~90 days of data, October pools: ~20 days of data, newer pools will have shorter lines on the chart)
- **Revenue Attribution**: Only revenue with pool attribution is included, some early transactions may lack `realized_by_pool` data, "unknown_pool" category represents unattributed revenue

**Data Update Frequency**

Pool ramp-up data is automatically updated once per day. Check the "Last updated" timestamp in the site header for data freshness.
