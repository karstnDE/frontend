# Pool Ramp-Up Analysis

This dashboard shows how pool revenue grew from establishment, comparing which pools gained the most user interest from inception.

## Multi-Pool Timeline

<BrowserOnly fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
  {() => {
    const PoolRampUpChart = require('@site/src/components/Dashboard/PoolRampUpChart').default;
    return <PoolRampUpChart />;
  }}
</BrowserOnly>

## Methodology

The pool ramp-up analysis tracks revenue growth from each pool's establishment to show which pools gained the most user interest early on.

### Key Concepts

- **Pool Establishment**: Defined as the first revenue-generating transaction from the pool
- **Day 1**: The first day a pool appears in `realized_by_pool` with revenue > 0
- **Cumulative Revenue**: Running total of all revenue generated by the pool since Day 1
- **Time Horizon**: First 90 days of each pool's life

### Data Source

Revenue data is extracted from the `realized_by_pool` field in daily `.realized.json` cache files:
- Each day's revenue is attributed to specific pool IDs
- Pool names are looked up from `config/pool_labels.json`
- Pools are sorted by total revenue (descending)

### Calculation Process

For each unique pool:

1. **Identify Establishment Date**: Find the first date with revenue > 0
2. **Build Daily Series**: Track revenue for each day from establishment
3. **Calculate Cumulative Total**: Sum all revenue from Day 1 to Day N
4. **Limit Time Window**: Track up to 90 days from establishment

### Example

For the Fusion SOL-USDC Pool established on 2025-07-31:

```
Day 1 (2025-07-31): 1.3e-05 SOL daily → 1.3e-05 SOL cumulative
Day 2 (2025-08-01): 0.0 SOL daily → 1.3e-05 SOL cumulative
Day 3 (2025-08-02): 1.5e-05 SOL daily → 2.9e-05 SOL cumulative
...
Day 90 (2025-10-28): 22.1 SOL daily → 1,650.43 SOL cumulative
```

## Understanding the Chart

The multi-line chart displays:

- **X-axis**: Days since establishment (1-90)
- **Y-axis**: Cumulative revenue in SOL
- **Lines**: One line per pool (all pools shown)
- **Colors**: Automatically assigned from theme palette

### Chart Features

- **Hover Tooltips**: Show pool name, day number, date, daily revenue, and cumulative total
- **Legend Toggle**: Click legend items to show/hide individual pools
- **Isolate Pool**: Double-click legend item to isolate a single pool
- **Zoom/Pan**: Drag to zoom into specific area, double-click chart to reset

### What to Look For

1. **Steepest Curves**: Pools with the fastest revenue growth from Day 1
2. **Early Leaders**: Pools that started generating significant revenue immediately
3. **Growth Patterns**: Some pools show steady growth, others show spikes
4. **Total Achievement**: Final cumulative value at Day 90 shows total revenue

## Limitations

### Establishment Date Accuracy

"First revenue date" may differ from actual pool creation:
- Some pools may have been created but inactive initially
- On-chain pool creation timestamp is not tracked
- We only detect when revenue first appears

### Data Availability Variance

Pools established at different times have different data coverage:
- July pools: ~90 days of data
- October pools: ~20 days of data
- Newer pools will have shorter lines on the chart

### Revenue Attribution

- Only revenue with pool attribution is included
- Some early transactions may lack `realized_by_pool` data
- "unknown_pool" category represents unattributed revenue

## Technical Details

For developers interested in the implementation:

- **Backend Script**: `tools/compute_pool_ramp_up.py`
- **Data Pipeline**: Integrated into `tools/precompute_site_data.py` (step 7.5)
- **Frontend Component**: `src/components/Dashboard/PoolRampUpChart.tsx`
- **Data File**: `static/data/pool_ramp_up.json`

### Data Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "generated_at": "2025-11-02T07:22:46Z",
    "max_days": 90,
    "total_pools": 44,
    "date_range": {"start": "2025-07-24", "end": "2025-10-31"}
  },
  "pools": [
    {
      "pool_id": "7VuK...",
      "name": "Fusion SOL-USDC Pool",
      "protocol": "Fusion",
      "establishment_date": "2025-07-31",
      "total_revenue": 1650.43,
      "days_of_data": 90,
      "days": [
        {"day": 1, "date": "2025-07-31", "daily": 0.000013, "cumulative": 0.000013},
        ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Update Frequency

Pool ramp-up data is regenerated when:
- New daily cache files are added
- Pool attribution is updated
- The analytics pipeline runs
