# Background & Motivation

I've been following the Blockchain/Crypto industry long before the Solana DeFi ecosystem came to be. My original focus was on other ecosystems, like Ethereum or XRPL. But regardless of which blockchain or ecosystem we talk about, for me it was always clear that we are seeing the rewiring of how financial services, infrastructure, and even trust works.

My professional background is in Management Consulting, and I've been working for a Big 4 firm for many years. I've supported major players across different industries in global technology-enabled transformations. But recently this was not something that I did with enthusiasm.

On the other hand: While I have no formal education or degree in Software Engineering, developing products has always been something I've enjoyed for various reasons:

- It's challenging, like a complex puzzle to solve
- You create something that others can use
- Not a lot of people can do it, so I had an edge and got business others didn't get

During my education years, I built software (web-based and mobile apps for phones/tablets), and I still look back fondly on that time for the reasons mentioned above.

Now I've decided to take a longer sabbatical to re-evaluate my next steps. This project is an outcome of this. I enjoy building it, and I want to see where it leads. This also means I'm open to collaboration—let me know if you want to discuss the content I provide, have ideas for covering certain topics, or think there are topics I could help you with based on what you see on this site.
